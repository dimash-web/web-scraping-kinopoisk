# Movie Scraper and Randomizer

## Project Overview

This project is a web scraper that collects a list of the top 250 movies from **Kinopoisk**, a popular movie rating platform across post-Soviet countries. The purpose of this scraper is to provide users with a curated list of top-rated movies, which can be filtered by genre and used for random movie selection. This project is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate the use of web scraping and randomization techniques.

## Data Description and Purpose

The purpose of collecting this data is to provide users with a list of highly rated movies from Kinopoisk and allow them to receive a random movie suggestion from the list. This project serves as an educational tool for demonstrating web scraping and data manipulation techniques.

## Website Used and Why
